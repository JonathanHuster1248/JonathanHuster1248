Hello, my name is Jonathan (Jon) Huster. I'm currently pursuing a masters in energy resources engineering at Stanford University. 
Professionally, I'm interested in energy, data, and modeling. Personally, I like playing boardgames, eating poke, and chilling with friends. 

My coding experiences have focused on data analysis and model building in R, particularly, developing features for GCAM, an economic energy model. 
I am continuing to build my skills in R, SQL, and Power-BI though an internship at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. I am also
attempting to learn some machine learning through online courses and independent study. 

Feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaborating on a research topic pertaining to energy and sustainability!
