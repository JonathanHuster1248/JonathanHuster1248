Hello, my name is Jonathan (Jon) Huster. I am a software engineer at Ascend Analytics. I have a background in energy from a Masters in Energy Resources Engineering at Stanford University. I am interested in energy systems, data science, and computer modeling.  

My coding experiences have focused on data analysis and model building. I have contributed to energy models in R and Python during my work at Pacific Northwest National Lab's Joint Global Change Research Institute and through my research with Ines Azevedo creating MACCPy. I am continuing to grow my repertoire by exploring personal projects in data science and automation ranging from predictive models for League of Legends (an online game I play in my free time) to creating a program to automate a grandfather clock. 

I am always interested in learing more and working with others, so feel free to reach out if you're interested in collaborating on a research topic pertaining to energy and sustainability!
